# Breast Cancer Classification Project
This is Logistic Regression classification project using the famous [UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29).
The data was in a .DATA file, which is also a part of this repository.


This project was a classic example of the procedure of logistic rergession. It includes data preprocessing, basic visualization, splitting the dataset into training and
testing data to overcome overfitting, creating the logistic regression model, its confusion matrix and result summary, and perform 10-fold cross validation.

This project uses Python's famous [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) machine learning package, alongwith [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [MissingNo](https://pypi.org/project/missingno/). For who do not have these installed, 
execute the following lines in your terminal:

```
pip install missingno
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
```
